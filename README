About Silverlight.FX

Silverlight.FX is an application framework for building Rich Internet
Applications based on Silverlight 2.

The focus is on enabling applications to be naturally better architected by
providing the right building blocks including:
- Promoting separation of view/code through well established patterns like
  IoC, MVVM, MVC
- Encapsulating functionality into reusable components like behaviors and
  services
- Making the right concepts declarative (eg. effects, behaviors)
- Overall better structuring of the application (eg. themes, controls)

Another equally important focus is on keeping the framework lean and mean
and being mindful of size - this is all about being a RIA/Web-friendly
framework. Currently the library comes in at ~70K compressed.
